# Michelle Example notes

Here are possible examples to put into the draft table.

  * https://github.com/Cray/chapel-private/issues/6617
  * https://github.com/Cray/chapel-private/issues/6805, this one ended up talking more about how to store a list of papers


### Examples
* examples from ChapelCon tutorial: [DanilaFe/chapelcon-2024-tutorial: Files and devcontainer configuration for the ChapelCon 2024 tutorial](https://github.com/DanilaFe/chapelcon-2024-tutorial), https://chapel-lang.org/docs/main/modules/packages/Image.html

* examples in primers and blogs

* from various Chapel tutorials
  * in the slides
  * in various GitHub repositories
      * https://github.com/DanilaFe/chapel-october-2023-tutorial
      * https://github.com/mstrout/ChapelForPythonProgrammersFeb2023
      * https://github.com/mstrout/ChapelForPythonProgrammersMay2023
  * https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/upcxx/wiki/events/CUF23

* advent of code repositories people have
  * https://github.com/mstrout/adventOfCode2023
  * Tim, Brad, John, Daniel, others?

* Arkouda, Tom Westerhout’s code, Scott’s prototype simulation, other “production” code that is openly available

* HPC carpentries, did Daniel’s PR update get merged?

* Monte Carlo example Engin did for Hui
  * https://github.com/e-kayrakli/mc321.chpl/tree/main
  * https://github.com/osimlab/MC321_Hui

* using Chapel for image processing example,  http://primachvis.com/pdf/chapel_by_ex.pdf, related to Hui Wang work, is this already on the potential blog post list?  Interesting, it also has kd trees in it, I should read some more.  Oh my goodness this is amazing!  It is 176 pages and has kmeans clustering as well.  I am going to put it back in my TODO list because it would be fun to work through the whole thing and develop a directory of test cases in the released examples directory.

* Jade did a demo on the image module with a bouncing Chapel logo on Aug 6, 2024, link for this?
  * Jade example GPU code, is that the same as above?

* https://www.reddit.com/r/chapel/comments/1fohxfw/llmchpl_an_llmc_port_in_chapel/

* 1BRC, Arkouda and Chapel examples

* Scott has about 5 repositories with Chapel examples, https://github.com/sdbachman

* link to ChOP code, https://github.com/tcarneirop/ChOp

* look on GitHub for other repositories that use Chapel or fall under the Chapel topic, https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Achapel-language&type=repositories

### Examples from others we may want to create a similar example for
  * Arkouda related, reading in large CSV files with Spark, https://towardsdatascience.com/pyspark-explained-the-inferschema-problem-12a08c989371
