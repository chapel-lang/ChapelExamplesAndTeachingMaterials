## Wednesday 7pm pacific / Thursday 9am GMT+10 (Australia and Asia-friendly time)

### Attendees

  * Josh M.
  * Michelle S.

### Key discussion points

  * Need to get Chapel in front of more undergraduates, potentially this group could design an intro to CS course based on Chapel?
  * A 3-hour workshop Josh developed and taught, https://github.com/ANU-HPC/chapelDeviceAgnostic
  * reduce the barrier to entry for someone who just wants to try out Chapel
    * programming models that have gone viral have focused on that initial issue, how to build and install
    * examples are spark and python, if it is easy to learn a little, then folks will stick with it due to the sunk cost fallacy
